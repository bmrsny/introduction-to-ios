# Storyboards

Storyboards allow us to create a user interface without having to write any code.

Xcode also features a library full of UI elements in its Asset Catalog. Simply choose which element you want to use and place it on your Storyboard.

* Start a new project
* Go to the Storyboard
* Drag a second ViewController on the Storyboard
* Click on the first Storyboard
* Select a "Button" from the Asset Catalog
* Snap it to the center of the ViewController
* Rename the button to "Forth"
* Hold control and drag to the second pane
* Change the action seque to "present modally"
* Click on the transition you just made
* Set the transition to "Page Curl"
* Add a button to the second ViewController
* Snap it to the center of the ViewController
* Rename the button to "Bact"
* Hold control and drag from the second ViewController to the first one
* Select "present modally"
* Select "Cross Dissolve"
* Click on the "Forth" button and "Add Missing Constraints"
* Click on the "Back" button and "Add Missing Contraints"
* Run it in the simulator

### Quick Practice

Can you add some additional buttons and try out some additional transitions?

You can either link to additional ViewControllers or make multiple transitions between the same two view controllers.
