# Pizza Please

Can you build a simple calculator that predicts how many pizzas we should order for a given number of people.

Your calculator should take at least two inputs:

* Number of People (defaults to ten)
* Average slices per person (defaults to two)

It should have some sort of field that displays the number of pizzas the user order.

## Extensions

* Can you also add a field that allows the user to enter the price of a pizza and then calculates the total price based on the number of pizzas.
* Can you also add the ability to factor in a tip?

## Example Code

You probably shouldn't look at this now, but if your reviewing the material at a later date, [here is an example of the code][pp] that could go in the ViewController.
